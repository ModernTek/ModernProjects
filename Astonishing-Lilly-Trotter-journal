#Astonishing-Lily-Trotter

Our team consists of two people: myself and Eric Fuller. We were given an assignment to develop *UI design for Blog.Modern Developer*.

We have communicated with Eric over google email.
It is happen that Eric Fuller is very expirienced CSS3 developer. On the other side, I am real newcomer to this area.
The fact that Eric Fuller is experienced CSS3 developer was very useful for the result of project, and also served me as a good learning experience.
Eric Fuller created github repository for the project and has divided development of UI into six parts.
I have developed the following three parts:

* Header
* [Content](https://github.com/efuller/md-blog-single/issues/2)
* [Side bar](https://github.com/efuller/md-blog-single/issues/3)

All other parts was developer by Eric.
Originally we have developed each part and commited to github as separate feature/branches: header, content, sidebar were developed by me; comments, related, footer were develop by Eric.
Later on, Eric merged all parts into develop branch and feature branches have been removed.

In general, Eric was very helpful to me. I guess that Eric is very busy, and I have to wait sometimes for week until he anwered my questions.
 
I still have number of questions unanswered and I hope that Eric will find time to answer them.

At the very end Eric merged all together in the master branch and beatifully edited my work. 

In a process of development, Eric provided very valuable advice to me; I did learn quite a bit from him.

I wish our communication with Eric was more interactive, not only emails. I thought that we can meet over google hangout to discuss the stuff, but this never happened. Eric also promised that we merged branches together, and this also never happen.

In the whole, it was really fasinating experience for me, and let me understand, how much I still have to learn.

For me this project was very challenging, and Eric contibution really makes it look so good.
